            <p>
            Bluetooth 5.0 is the latest version of the <strong>Bluetooth wireless communication standard</strong>. 
            It’s commonly used for wireless headphones and other audio hardware, as well as wireless keyboards, mice, and game controllers.
            Bluetooth is also used for communication between various smart home and Internet of Things (IoT) devices.
			A new version of the Bluetooth standard means various <strong>improvements</strong>, but only when used with compatible peripherals. 
            In other words, you won’t see any immediate benefit from upgrading to a phone with Bluetooth 5.0 if all your Bluetooth accessories were designed for an older version of Bluetooth. 
            Bluetooth is <strong>backwards</strong> compatible, however, so you can continue using your existing Bluetooth 4.2 and older devices with a Bluetooth 5.0 phone. 
            And, when you buy new Bluetooth 5.0-enabled peripherals, they’ll <strong>work better</strong> thanks to your Bluetooth 5.0 phone.

          <div class="col-8 offset-1">
            <p> Solar panels are devices that convert <strong>light into electricity</strong>. 
            They are called "solar" panels because most of the time, the most <strong>powerful</strong> source of light available is the Sun, called Sol by astronomers. 
            Some scientists call them photovoltaics which means, basically, "light-electricity."
            A solar panel is a <strong>collection of solar cells</strong>. 
            Lots of small solar cells spread over a large area can work together to provide <strong>enough power to be useful</strong>. 
            <strong>The more</strong> light that hits a cell, <strong>the more</strong> electricity it produces.

            <h3>GPS: the Satellites as your Guardians</h3>
          </div>

          <div class="col-8 offset-1">
            <p>The Global Positioning System (<strong>GPS</strong>) is a technical marvel made possible by a <strong>group of satellites</strong> in Earth's orbit. 
            It transmits precise signals, allowing GPS receivers to calculate and display accurate <strong>location</strong>, speed, and time information to the user. GPS is owned by the U.S.
			By capturing the signals from satellites, GPS receivers are able to use the mathematical principle of <strong>trilateration</strong> to pinpoint your location. With the addition 
            of computing power and data stored in memory such as road maps, points of interest, topographic information, and much more, 
            GPS receivers are able to convert location, speed, and time information into a useful display format.

            <h3>Fingerprints: Unlocking just for you</h3>
          </div>
          <div class="col-8 offset-1">
            <p>A fingerprint scanner (or fingerprint reader/fingerprint sensor) is a <strong>biometric scanner</strong>.
            It works by scanning a fingerprint and attempting to <strong>match</strong> it against one that has been pre-stored electronically within the system. 
            If the finger scanner recognises a match, it will grant permission.
            The main advantage of this type of biometric scanner is that it eliminates issues such as the possible duplication or sharing of swipe cards or fobs.
            <strong>The authorised individual</strong> simply <strong>has to be there in person</strong> in order to operate a biometric device, such as a fingerprint door lock. 
            This makes it an <strong>ultra-secure</strong> solution

            <p>You may have heard the word “pH” used to describe drinking water <strong>quality</strong>, but do you know what it means?
			pH is a measurement of <strong>electrically charged</strong> particles in a substance. 
            It indicates how acidic or alkaline (basic) that substance is. The pH scale ranges from 0 (most acidic) to 14 (most alkaline).
            Freshwater pH varies across the world <strong>depending on</strong> weather patterns, human activity, and natural processes.
			Water with a very low or high pH <strong>can be a sign</strong> of chemical or heavy metal pollution.
            With our sensor you can check <strong>immediately</strong>.
